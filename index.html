    <h1>Front-end Development is the Worst</h1>
    <p>
        Look, front-end development is for script kiddies and soydevs who can't handle the real programming. I mean,
        it's just a bunch of divs and spans, right? And css??? It's like, "Oh, I want this to be red, but not thaaaaat
        red." What a joke.
    </p>
    <p>
        Real programmers code, not silly markup languages. They code on Arch Linux, not Mac OS, and certainly not
        Windows. They use Vim, not VS Code. They use C, not HTML. Come to the
        <a href="https://www.boot.dev">backend</a>, where the real programming
        happens.

    <html> is the root element of the document.
    <head> contains metadata about the document. Anything in the <head> is not rendered visibly in the browser window.
        <title> is the title of the document, which is displayed in the browser tab.
    <body> contains the content of the document, which is what is rendered in the browser window.
        <h1> is a top-level heading.
        <p> is a paragraph of text.
        <a> is a hyperlink. The href attribute is the URL the link points to. Attributes are key-value pairs that provide additional information about an element, like href="https://www.boot.dev".
